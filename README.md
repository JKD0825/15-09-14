Today,I see the iOS video try to learn the iOS develop.
I found out that is more than easy to I think.
All you need to do is follow the video step by step to set up you computer.
But I know,If you want to learn iOS develop,it is far from enough.
But consider my situation,it is the best way for me.
In the near future,I believe I will no need to see the video just need the book or some text and try and try again to learn iOS develop.
